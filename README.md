## aws-glue-etl-local-docker
[Link to Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jnshubham/glue_etl_local)

This docker image is used to run your glue etl jobs on your local environment.
This helps in the development of etl jobs locally without incurring additional costs by running Glue Devendpoints or Glue jobs.

Having glue libraries locally helps in the development and making it easier for the developer to update/change the code and test it locally before commiting it to a job.
